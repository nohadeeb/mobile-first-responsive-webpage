# mobile-first-responsive-webpage

in this task the challenge was duplicating and develop a fully responsive web page with the best code structure.
I used javascript only on the header and menu section , to convert the regular desktop header to a mobile header with burger menu added.
javascript code : close-btn() open-btn() and dropwn internal menu.

for all elemnet and sections on the webpage I used either the percentage or the EM to set the width - height - padding- marging in order to achieve fully responsive items .

lastly for implementing media query using preprocessor SASS after finishing all sections and for the best code organizing and refactoring
I chose to use mixins and seperate each section in a file which will include it's media query code.
But unfortunatley I faced a conflict between breakpoints mixins and flexbox which was weird , and this strategy implemented only the the slider section for revealing the concept and all SCSS files are added.
